    <p>Hello! Iâ€™m a student at Syracuse University currently studying Magazine, News and Digital Journalism at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. In my previous roles, I developed my writing skills and discovered my passion for journalism, covering a variety of different sports. Right now, I am currently an assistant sports editor at The Daily Orange, Syracuse's independent, student-run newspaper.</p>
