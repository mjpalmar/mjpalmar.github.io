    <p>Hello! My name is Mauricio Palmar, and I’m a student at Syracuse University currently studying Magazine, News and Digital Journalism at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. In the past, I have interned at the Severna Park Voice and interned as a beat writer for the Chatham Anglers in the Cape Cod Baseball League. Right now, I am currently an assistant sports editor at The Daily Orange, Syracuse's independent, student-run newspaper.</p>
